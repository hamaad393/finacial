# In this project, we have used python 3.6 on on jupyter notebook .with Respect to time we have predicted about the prices on a specific time series. 


This is jupyter noteboo, notebook where you have to upload this  file only  and run why push the play button over the Jupiter virtual notebook and you have to follow each code bar which is given in this notebook and you have to run. 
Everything in this is defined and coded properly so there is no issue to make any type of change or to update any type of code or you import any type of thing so so just upload it to Jupyter and enjoy. 


Moreover, if you are not willing to  run this file on a jupyter notebook. you can just simply make a Python file just paste the code of this notebook apart from the text and headings import the models like matplotlib Pandas statistics map and scikit-learn and run it so there is no issue.
